    "We see some missing values represented with a \"?\". Probably these were the questions not answered by some people during the census.  Usually `.describe()` or `.info()` methods would give you information on missing values. But here, they won't pick \"?\" as missing values because they are encoded as strings instead of an actual NaN in Python. So let's replace them with `np.nan` before we carry out EDA. If you do not do it, you'll encounter an error later on when you try to pass this data to a classifier. "

    "People who make more than 50,000 tend to be a little older than people who make less than 50,000. The age distribution is also more skewed toward middle-aged groups. The feature for capital.gain is very right-skewed, with most values being zero. However, people with high incomes tend to have more and bigger non-zero gains. Capital loss is also very concentrated at zero, but a few high-income people do show bigger loss values. For education.The >50K group is clearly linked to higher levels of education, while the <=50K group is more focused on lower values. On the other hand, fnlwgt shows a lot of overlap between the two income classes, which means it might not be as useful. Finally, for hours per week, both groups peak at about 40 hours, but the group with more than 50K seems to have more people who work longer hours. These skewed features may require transformation or careful preprocessing before modeling."

    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

How many new columns have been created in the preprocessed data in comparison to the original `X_train`? Store the difference between the number of columns in `transformed_df` and `X_train` in a variable called `n_new_cols`. \n",

    "2.The Golden Rule tells us not to use the test or validation data while training or choosing model settings. If we violate it, the model evaluation may look better than it really is because the model indirectly got help from the test data. It might not make the classifier worse, but it makes the results less trustworthy.\n",
